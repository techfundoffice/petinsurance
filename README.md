## High-Value Adjacent Niche Keywords Strategy

### Target These Premium Keywords Next!
These represent significant opportunities with CPCs often 2-3x higher than general pet insurance.

#### Top 3 Highest-Value Niches:

**1. Emergency Veterinary Services ($15-50+ CPC)**
- "emergency vet near me" - $25-45 CPC
- "24 hour emergency vet" - $20-40 CPC
- "pet emergency hospital" - $18-35 CPC

**2. Veterinary Oncology ($20-80+ CPC)**
- "veterinary oncologist" - $40-80 CPC
- "pet cancer treatment" - $35-70 CPC
- "dog radiation therapy" - $45-85 CPC

**3. Veterinary Specialty Surgery ($15-60+ CPC)**
- "pet orthopedic surgeon" - $30-60 CPC
- "dog ACL surgery cost" - $35-70 CPC
- "pet heart surgery" - $40-80 CPC

#### Why These Work:
- Same target audience (affluent pet owners)
- Natural extension from insurance (covering expensive procedures)
- Higher urgency = higher conversion rates
- Premium pricing justifies high CPCs

#### Strategic Advantage:
Emergency and specialty care keywords have the highest commercial intent because pet owners facing $5,000-15,000+ procedures are actively seeking solutions. These are your insurance prospects at their moment of highest need.

#### Recommended Entry Strategy:
Start with emergency vet keywords since they have the highest search volume and most urgent need, then expand into specialty services. Create content around "How much does [expensive procedure] cost?" to capture high-intent traffic.

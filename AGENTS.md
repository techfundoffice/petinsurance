## 🎯 SEO Implementation Standards

### HTML Structure Requirements
```html
<!-- CORRECT Structure -->
<main>
  <nav class="breadcrumb">...</nav>
  <article>
    <header>
      <h1>${title}</h1> <!-- NOT H2! -->
      <time>Published: ${date}</time>
    </header>
    <nav class="toc">...</nav>
    <section>...</section>
  </article>
</main>
```

### Internal Linking Requirements
- **First paragraph**: 5-6 internal links minimum
- **Per section**: 2-3 contextual links
- **Total per page**: 20-30 internal links
- **Anchor text**: Descriptive keywords (not "click here")

### Why This Matters
- Missing H1 = -15 SEO points
- No breadcrumbs = -10 points  
- Poor internal linking = -10 points
- Wrong HTML tags = -5 points
- **Total potential loss: -40 points**

## ⚠️ Performance Patterns to Follow

### ✅ DO: Use simple static strings

```js
introduction: `When it comes to ${title}, understanding your options is crucial...`
```

### ❌ DO NOT: Use complex transformation logic

```js
// This causes CPU timeouts
const article = baseContent.split(' ').map(word => synonyms[word] || word).join(' ');
```

---

## 🛠 Maintenance Guidelines

### Content Updates
* Keywords list is hardcoded in `getAllKeywords()`
* Add new keywords by appending to the array and updating routing logic
* To update article structure, edit `generateArticleContent()` templates
* Ensure keyword consistency to avoid content duplication

### SEO Maintenance 
* **Always maintain H1 tags** - Never change to H2
* **Preserve internal links** - Must have 20-30 per page
* **Keep semantic HTML** - Don't replace with divs
* **Test changes** - Run through PageSpeed Insights
* **Validate schema** - Use Google's Rich Results Test
* **Check heading hierarchy** - H1→H2→H3 order

### Before Deploying Changes
1. Check H1 tag is present and unique
2. Verify breadcrumb schema is valid
3. Count internal links (minimum 20)
4. Test one page in PageSpeed Insights
5. Ensure no CPU timeouts with new changes

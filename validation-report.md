## Distribution Pattern

The breed keywords were integrated into the main keyword array rather than appended at the end, resulting in breed pages being distributed throughout the site (pages 11, 161, 251, etc.) rather than clustered at the end. This actually provides better site structure and avoids having all similar content grouped together.

## Conclusion

The breed-specific content expansion has been successfully validated. The site now offers comprehensive pet insurance information across 1,377 pages, including dedicated pages for 100 dog breeds and 50 cat breeds, each with multiple keyword variations. All technical requirements have been met, and the implementation follows SEO best practices.

### Next Steps Recommendations:
1. Add location-based content (pet insurance by state/city)
2. Add condition-specific pages (diabetes, arthritis, allergies)
3. Add cost comparison pages (company vs company)
4. Create more detailed content templates for each specialty
